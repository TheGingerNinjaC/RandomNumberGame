# Random Number Guessing Game

Programming problem from Starting Out with Visual C# (4th ed.) by Tony Gaddis

Application that generates a random number between 1 and 100.  User guesses a number
and program provides the following feedback:

  if guess higher than number: too high, try again.
  
  if guess lower than number: too low, try again.
  
  if guess is equal to number: amount of guesses it took.

After the user guesses the right number, a new round starts.

I added a clear button to clear the ListBox control and start a new game.
